== Introduction

SlideshowFX is an application allowing you to create HTML5 based presentation in a very common manner. Nowadays we all use PowerPoint, Keynote and their friends but with evolution of web technologies, new perspectives are now possible. Indeed there is a lot of HTML5/JavaScript based framework, like http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/[reveal.js] or https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/[impress.js], that allow you to create beautiful presentations to keep your audience active. It brings you a lot of freedom like adding a YouTube video right inside your presentation, playing music, automatically syntax highlighting code example and more. But to do such presentations you have to know HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages.

SlideshowFX lets programming languages to developers and presentations' creation to end users. This means that you will be able to create your presentations without knowing HTML, even if it is recommended to have the basics.

But SlideshowFX isn't just another simple presentation engine. It brings much more for you:

- A chat is provided so your audience can send you questions using their smartphones and you will answer them whenever you want ;
- A quiz creator so your audience can answer your quiz using their smartphones and you see results live ;
- Save your presentations on Box, Dropbox or Google Drive ;
- Insert code snippets that can be executed directly from the presentation and console's output is displayed in the slide.

=== Gradle

SlideshowFX uses https://gradle.org/[gradle] as build system. The version used is {gradle-version}.

==== Particularities

The documentation provided within the SlideshowFX application is the same as the one provided by the setup. In order to avoid duplicate files, the `slideshowfx-app` module unpacks the `slideshowfx-documentation` HTML documentation in its own sources. In order to update the documentation within the application and display it in the application during development, the following command could be used:

[source]
----
gradlew :slideshowfx-app:processResources
----

==== Custom tasks

Some gradle tasks are provided to help the developer :

- *installPlugin* provided for all plugins and allowing to deploy the plugin directly to the folder : `~/.SlideshowFX/plugins` ;
- *listSnapshotProjects* allowing to list projects having a `SNAPSHOT` version. This is particularly useful for knowing which project should update it's version before publishing ;
- *saveProjectsToBePublished* allowing to save within the `gradle.properties` file the projects having a `SNAPSHOT` version and that should be published on bintray ;
- *:slideshowfx-app:createSlideContentEditor* allows to build the `sfx-slide-content-editor.zip` archive when passing the `-PaceVersion=xxx` property on the command line ;
- *:slideshowfx-alert-extension:createSweetAlertPackage* allows to build the `sweetalert.zip` archive when passing the `-PsweetAlertVersion=xxx` property on the command line ;
- *:slideshowfx-shape-extension:createSnapSVGPackage* allows to build the `snapsvg.zip` archive when passing the `-PsnapSvgVersion=xxx` property on the command line.

=== Set up your environment

==== Environment variable

In order to build SlideshowFX, you will need to set *JAVA_HOME* to point to your JDK {jdk-version} installation. Ensure the variable the present in the *PATH* environment variable.

==== Running SlideshowFX in your IDE

If you are contributing to SlideshowFX and developing some features, you probably use an IDE (http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA], https://netbeans.org/[NetBeans], http://www.eclipse.org/[eclipse], ...). +

In order to start the application from your IDE, you can start the `com.twasyl.slideshowfx.app.SlideshowFX` class.

=== Creating templates

Each presentation done with SlideshowFX is based on a _template_.  +
A template is composed by four main parts:

- A _template configuration_ file which contains the configuration of the template. This file *must be* named *template-config.json* and is written using JSON ;
- A _template file_ which is the HTML page that will host all slides of the presentation ;
- A _sample file_ which is an HTML page providing a sample of the template ;
- _Slide's template files_ which are the template for each kind of slide the user can add in his presentation.

All of this content is archived in a file with the extension *.sfxt* (which stands for SlideshowFX template)

A typical template archive structure is the following:
[source]
----
/
|- [F] template-config.json
|- [F] template.html
|- [F] sample.html
|- [D] resources
|- [D] slides
|------|- [D] template
----

Where:

- *[F]* = file
- *[D]* = directory

==== Template configuration file

The template configuration must be at the root of the archive and will contain all the configuration the template will need to load. An example is show below:
[source]
----
{
  "template" : {
    "name": "My first template",
    "version" : "0.2",
    "file" : "template.html",
    "js-object" : "sfx",
    "resources-directory" : "resources",

    "default-variables" : [
        {
            "name" : "author",
            "value" : "<content encoded in Base64>"
        },
        {
            "name" : "twitter",
            "value" : "<content encoded in Base64>"
        }
    ],

    "slides" : {
      "configuration" : {
        "slides-container" : "slideshowfx-slides-div",
        "slide-id-prefix" : "slide-",
        "template-directory" : "slides/template",
      },
      "slides-definition" : [
        {
          "id" : 1,
          "name" : "Title",
          "file" : "title.html",
          "elements" : [
            {
              "id" : 1,
              "html-id" : "${slideNumber}-title",
              "default-content" : "Title"
            }, {
              "id" : 2,
              "html-id" : "${slideNumber}-subtitle",
              "default-content" : "Subtitle"
            }, {
               "id" : 3,
               "html-id" : "${slideNumber}-author",
               "default-content" : "Author"
            }, {
               "id" : 4,
               "html-id" : "${slideNumber}-twitter",
               "default-content" : "@Twitter"
             }
          ]
        },
        {
          "id" : 2,
          "name" : "Title and content",
          "file" : "title_content.html",
          "elements" : [
            {
              "id" : 1,
              "html-id" : "${slideNumber}-title",
              "default-content" : "Title"
            }, {
              "id" : 2,
              "html-id" : "${slideNumber}-content",
              "default-content" : "Content"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "id" : 3,
          "name" : "Empty",
          "file" : "empty.html",
          "elements" : [
            {
              "id" : 1,
              "html-id" : "${slideNumber}-content",
              "default-content" : "Content"
            }
          ],
          "dynamic-attributes" : [
            {
              "attribute" : "data-x",
              "template-expression" : "slideDataX",
              "prompt-message" : "Enter X position of the slide:"
            },
            {
              "attribute" : "data-y",
              "template-expression" : "slideDataY",
              "prompt-message" : "Enter Y position of the slide:"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

The complete configuration is wrapped into a *template* JSON object. This object is described as below:

* *name* : the name of the template ;
* *version* : the version of the template ;
* *file* : the HTML file that is the template, which will host the slides ;
* *js-object* : is the name JavaScript object that will be used to callback to SlideshowFX ;
* *slides-container* : is the ID of the HTML markup that will contain the slides ;
* *resources-directory* : the folder that will contain the resources of the presentation, typically images file, sounds, etc ;
* *default-variables* : define custom variables that can be used inside the presentation. It is not mandatory ;
** *name* : the name of the variable ;
** *value* : the value of the variable encoded in Base64 ;
* *slides* : define the configuration of slides inside the presentation, as well as their template ;
** *configuration* : JSON object that will contain the configuration of the slides ;
*** *slide-id-prefix* : is a prefix that will be placed in the ID attribute of an HTML slide element, prefixing the slide number ;
*** *template-directory* : the directory that will contain the slide’s templates ;
** *slides-definition* : a JSON array that will contain the definition of each slide template as a JSON object with the following structure:
*** *id* : the ID of the slide ;
*** *name* : the name of the slide that will be displayed in SlideshowFX in the lst of available slide’s type ;
*** *file* : the template file of the slide ;
*** *elements* : a JSON array composed of JSON documents that describe all elements that can be dynamic modified (by the user or by SlideshowFX):
**** *id* : the ID for the element ;
**** *html-id* : the HTML ID of the element within the presentation. It can contain variable ;
**** *default-content* : the default content for the element ;
*** *dynamic-attributes* : a JSON array composed of JSON object describing the attributes that can be dynamically created when creating a slide by prompting its value to the user. Each object is structured as follow:
**** *attribute* : the name of the attribute ;
**** *template-expression* : the name of the template token. It is the Velocity token without the dollar sign ;
**** *prompt-message* : the message displayed to the user asking the value of the attribute.

NOTE: The best way for creating the template configuration file is to use the editor available in SlideshowFX.

==== Template file

The template file is the file that will host all slides, include all JavaScript libraries, CSS files and so on. In order to work, you have to:

- insert the freemarker token *$\{sfxJavascriptResources\}* inside a *script* code block
- define an ID for the HTML element that will host all slides
- insert the JavaScript function with the right implementation returning the current slide

[source,javascript]
----
function slideshowFXGetCurrentSlide() {
  // Return the current slide
}
----

- insert the JavaScript function with the right implementation to go to a specified slide

[source,javascript]
----
function slideshowFXGotoSlide(slideId) {
  // Go to the slide identified by the given ID
}
----

- insert the JavaScript function with the right implementation to go to the next slide

[source,javascript]
----
function slideshowFXNextSlide() {
  // Go to the next slide
}
----

- insert the JavaScript function with the right implementation to go to the previous slide

[source,javascript]
----
function slideshowFXPreviousSlide() {
  // Go to the previous slide
}
----

==== Slide’s template file

The template of a slide will define what HTML element a slide is. In some frameworks it will be a *section* markup, in others a *div* and so on. In order to create a template, you will have to respect some pre-requisites:

- The slide markup must have its ID attribute set to *$\{slideIdPrefix\}$\{slideNumber}*
- Each element that is editable by the user must have an ID attribute composed of the slide number and a discriminator. An example of the title of the slide:
[source,html]
<h1 id="${slideNumber}-title"></h1>
- Each element that is editable by the user must have the *ondblclick* attribute set to *$\{sfxCallback\}*
- It is strongly recommended to listen to slide changed event in the template file. When such an event is fired, you can call notify the SlideshowFX browser with the new current slide ID:
[source,html]
----
var slide = ...; // i.e.: document.getElementById(...)
sfxBrowser.fireSlideChangedEvent(slide.id);
----
- If dynamic attributes are needed, they can be defined like the following. Note that for this example, template-expression are *slideDataX* and *slideDataY*
[source,html]
<section ${slideDataX} ${slideDataY}></section>

==== Valid template engine tokens

The following template engine tokens are available for SlideshowFX:

* *$\{slideIdPrefix\}* indicates the prefix that will be placed before the slide number for each slide ;
* *$\{slideNumber\}* indicates the slide number generated by SlideshowFX ;
* *$\{sfxCallback\}* indicates the function that will call SlideshowFX from JavaScript ;
* *$\{sfxJavascriptResources\}* indicates the JavaScript resources SlideshowFX will insert in the presentation, like the one for inserting content, calling a quiz etc.

=== Presentations

Presentations made with SlideshowFX are an archive with the *.sfx* extension. The archive contains:

- The whole template structure
- The *presentation.html* file which is the whole presentation
- The *presentation-config.json* which is the whole configuration of the presentation

==== Configuration file

The configuration of the presentation is wrapped into an JSON configuration file named *presentation-config.json*. Here is a configuration example:
[source]
----
